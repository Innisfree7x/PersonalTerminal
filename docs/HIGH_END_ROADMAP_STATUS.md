# High-End Roadmap Status (INNIS)

Last updated: 2026-02-21

## Original scope decision

- Included in initial high-end roadmap: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9`
- Deferred by product decision: `7 (AI/RAG)`, `8 (Predictive Productivity)`, `10 (Storybook)`

## Completion snapshot

1. Server Actions + type-safe mutations: `100%`
2. Optimistic UI (critical flows): `100%`
3. Architecture layering (app/domain separation baseline): `100%`
4. Layout transitions (core cards/modals): `100%`
5. Sound design baseline: `100%`
6. Command bar actions: `100%`
9. E2E testing baseline (agreed critical flows): `100%`

## Extended completion after roadmap (Phase 8–11)

### Phase 8 / 8.1
- Marketing site shipped and hardened.
- Brand consolidated to INNIS (dark + red + gold).
- SEO + sitemap + robots + conversion analytics baseline.

### Phase 9 / 10 / 10.1
- Activation and onboarding quality significantly improved.
- Metrics loop and event contract established.
- Privacy/analytics messaging aligned with implementation.

### Phase 11
- Dashboard query and index performance improvements.
- Lucian context-aware hint engine integrated.
- Email notifications via cron routes + settings opt-out.
- Blocker E2E suite in CI (serial gate).

## Current platform status

- Product quality: high for solo/early-user usage.
- Reliability posture: materially improved.
- Remaining practical ops: env hygiene + cron verification + routine release gates.

## Next directional phases

- `Phase 12`: scale-ready core (reliability + KPI operations)
- `Phase 13`: monetization and growth engine
- `Phase 14`: intelligent product layer (strictly utility-driven)
