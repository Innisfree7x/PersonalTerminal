You are building a personal productivity command center with Next.js 14.

ARCHITECTURE:
- app/ for routes, components/ for reusable UI, lib/ for utilities
- Server Components by default, 'use client' only when necessary
- Zod for all data validation, TypeScript strict mode
- React Query for data fetching, no useState for server data

CODE STYLE:
- Functional components only, no classes
- Explicit return types for functions
- No 'any' types, use 'unknown' if needed
- Error handling: try/catch with typed errors
- Keep components under 200 lines, extract to subcomponents

TESTING:
- Write tests BEFORE implementing features (TDD)
- Test file naming: ComponentName.test.tsx
- Cover: happy path, edge cases, error states
- Use Testing Library queries (getByRole, getByText)

DATA FLOW:
- Props drilling max 2 levels, then use Context/Zustand
- All external data through React Query
- Form state with controlled components + Zod validation

DEPENDENCIES:
- Prefer standard libraries over bloat
- Check bundle size before adding (use bundlephobia)
- Document WHY each dependency exists

When I say "implement X", you:
1. Ask clarifying questions about edge cases
2. Suggest the data structure/types first
3. Write the test cases
4. Then implement
5. Suggest refactoring opportunities

Be opinionated. Challenge my decisions if they create tech debt.
